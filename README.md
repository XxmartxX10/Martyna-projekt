## General info
Insertion sort is used unknowingly by most players when arranging the cards dealt in the hand. The idea of ​​the algorithm: at the moment we keep in our hand sorted cards and the remaining cards to be sorted.
	We write (draw) an algorithm in order to be able to create a computer program. When creating a program, we convert the concepts of our language (the language we speak) or the graphic symbols of the flowchart into instructions that are understood by the computer. We can say that a computer program is an algorithm written in "computer language". Unfortunately, computers only process strings of ones and zeros.
